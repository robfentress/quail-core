# Deprecation

All projects have a useful lifespan. Quail was born during a time when accessibility
testing, as a discipline, was maturing. There were numerous teams building solutions
in parallel -- Quail was just one of these. In the end, we were all orbiting around
the same general approach. Technology may have been a distinguishing factor a couple
years ago, but even these advantages have largely dissolved as solutions have evolved
and improved over time.

Given the realities of the market and the limited time that the Quail team can
devote to this project, we are initializing deprecation for this project. Folks
are welcome to fork it or volunteer to maintain it, but realistically, there are
better options out there.

If you are looking for one, we recommend [aXe: the Accessibility Engine](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) by [Deque Labs](https://github.com/dequelabs).
